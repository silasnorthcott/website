  <section id="about">
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm completing my Bachelor's in Health and Exercise Sciences at UBC Okanagan, where
      I study the workings of the body and the wider influences on health.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in physiotherapy developed through sustained involvement in sport; both
      as an athlete and in applied sports medicine roles. These experiences shaped how I
      think about injury not just as a physical event, but as something that affects
      self-efficacy. I'm currently interested in pursuing a pediatric focus, but I am open
      to other focuses as well.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="interests">
    <h2>What I’m interested in</h2>
    <p>
      I’m drawn to physiotherapy because it sits at the intersection of movement and
      human interaction. Areas I’m particularly interested in include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exercise-based rehabilitation grounded in physiology and biomechanics</li>
      <li>Helping patients understand their injury and recovery process</li>
      <li>Using simple tools or technology to support adherence and progress tracking</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="academics">
    <h2>Academic focus</h2>
    <p>
      My academic training emphasizes the foundational sciences required for physiotherapy
      practice, including anatomy, human physiology, biomechanics, and the psychological
      and social factors that influence health outcomes.

  <section id="experience">
    <h2>Experience & applied work</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve gained early applied experience in sports medicine through hands-on roles
      supporting high school athletic teams in competitive environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a junior and senior sports trainer, I worked closely with athletes, coaches, and
      staff during training and competition, gaining exposure to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>On-field injury recognition and basic management</li>
      <li>Clear communication with injured athletes under pressure</li>
      <li>Supporting safe return-to-play decisions</li>
      <li>Understanding the practical realities of injury in team settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These roles reinforced my interest in rehabilitation-focused care and highlighted
      the importance of communication, trust, and patient understanding throughout the
      recovery process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside this, I’ve explored small web-based projects related to rehabilitation and
      clinic workflows. This includes a rehab progression tracker and a physiotherapy clinic
      demo site.
    </p>

  <section id="contact">
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      I’m always open to conversations about anything, especially physiotherapy, 
      rehabilitation, nutrition, and movement science.
